## less

 read contents of text file one page(one screen) per time. It has faster access because if file is large, it don’t access complete file, but access it page by page.


```

```

## grep

Grep command in Unix/Linux is the short form of ‘global search for the regular expression’.
The grep command is a filter that is used to search for lines matching a specified pattern and print the matching lines to standard output.

**Syntax :**

```
grep [options] [pattern] [file]
```

```
~ grep "Desktop" os_lab.txt
Desktop
```

## su

changes the current user ID to that of the superuser, or another specified user.
which is short for substitute user or switch user, enables the current user to act as another user during the current login session.

**Syntax :**

```
su [options] [username]
```

If no username is specified, su defaults to becoming the superuser (root).

#### su VS sudo :
sudo runs a single command with root privileges, su launches another shell instance with the privileges of the intended user. Both, sudo and su, are use to grant root privileges to the users in different manners.

## passwd

change the password of a user account. A normal user can run passwd to change their own password, and a system administrator (the superuser) can use passwd to change another user's password, or define how that account's password can be used or changed.

```
➜  ~ passwd
Changing password for alireza.
Current password:
New password:
Retype new password:
passwd: password updated successfully

```

## redirect or (>>, >)

  * ">" : replace new value with previous one
  * ">>" : append new value to previous one
```
➜  ~ cat >> test

➜  ~ cat test
First line.
Second Line.
➜  ~ sudo cat > test
Removed pre lines.
➜  ~ cat test

## pipline or ( | )

The Pipe is a command in Linux that lets you use two or more commands such that output of one command serves as input to the next. In short, the output of each process directly as input to the next one like a pipeline. The symbol '|' denotes a pipe.

Pipes help you mash-up two or more commands at the same time and run them consecutively. You can use powerful commands which can perform complex tasks in a jiffy.
